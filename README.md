# Shadow Wizard Money Game
The first program I ever wrote, a two player Rocks Paper Scissors style console game written in C# for a school assignment.

Game mechanics are generic triagle of strengths vs weaknesses except with a shadow wizard theme to make it slightly more interesting. 

Both players enter their name and attacks, overall winner is whoever has the most wins either at the end of five rounds or when a player quits, results of each round are saved to a log file.
